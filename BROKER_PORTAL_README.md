```

### API Endpoints

#### Public
- `POST /api/portal/auth` - Login (handled by Supabase)

#### Protected (Admin Only)
- `GET /api/portal/brokers` - List all brokers
- `POST /api/portal/brokers` - Create broker
- `GET /api/portal/brokers/[id]` - Get broker details
- `PATCH /api/portal/brokers/[id]` - Update broker
- `DELETE /api/portal/brokers/[id]` - Delete broker

### User Roles

#### Broker (Standard User)
- View own clients
- Create/edit own clients
- View applications for own clients
- Create/edit applications for own clients
- Upload/download documents
- Change own password
- Access: Dashboard, Applications, Clients, Settings

#### Admin
- All broker permissions, plus:
- View all clients (any broker)
- View all applications (any broker)
- Create/edit/delete broker accounts
- Access: Dashboard, Applications, Clients, Brokers, Settings

### What's NOT Included (Future Features)

These were deliberately left out for MVP:

- Email notifications
- SMS notifications  
- Real-time updates (WebSockets)
- Advanced reporting/analytics
- Data export (CSV/Excel)
- Lender API integrations
- Client-facing portal
- Mobile app
- Multi-factor authentication
- Audit logs
- Advanced search filters
- Calendar/scheduling
- Task management
- Commission tracking

### Performance Considerations

- Server components used for data fetching (better performance)
- Client components only where interactivity is needed
- Indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried columns
- Lazy loading of documents list
- Efficient RLS policies using EXISTS subqueries

### Known Limitations

1. **File uploads**: Limited by Supabase free tier (1GB)
2. **Search**: Basic text filtering (no fuzzy search)
3. **Pagination**: Not implemented (fine for <1000 records)
4. **Offline support**: None (requires internet connection)
5. **Bulk operations**: No bulk edit/delete
6. **Data validation**: Basic client-side only

### Cost Estimate

#### Free Tier (Supabase)
- 500MB database storage
- 1GB file storage
- 50k monthly active users
- Unlimited API requests
- **Cost**: $0/month

#### Paid Tier (When you scale)
- Supabase Pro: $25/month
  - 8GB database
  - 100GB file storage
  - 100k monthly active users
- Vercel Pro: Free (already have domain)
- **Total**: ~$25/month

### Getting Started

See `BROKER_PORTAL_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions.

Quick start:
1. Create Supabase project
2. Run database migrations
3. Set up environment variables
4. Create admin user
5. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
6. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/portal/login`

### Deployment

The portal is Vercel-ready. Just:
1. Add environment variables to Vercel
2. Push to git
3. Vercel auto-deploys

### Maintenance

- **Database backups**: Automatic (Supabase)
- **Updates**: Standard Next.js/npm updates
- **Monitoring**: Supabase dashboard provides logs

## Philosophy

This implementation follows the Pieter Levels approach:

✅ **Ship fast** - Built in a weekend, ready to use Monday  
✅ **Start simple** - CRUD operations only, add features as needed  
✅ **Use boring tech** - Postgres, React, no fancy stuff  
✅ **Real data** - No mock data, real database from day 1  
✅ **Good enough UI** - Clean and functional, not over-designed  
✅ **Iterate based on use** - Add features when users ask for them  

## What's Next?

Start using it! The best way to improve the portal is to use it daily and note what's missing or frustrating. Then add those features one at a time.

Suggested order:
1. Use for 1 week as-is
2. Add most annoying missing feature
3. Repeat

Don't build features you "might need" - build what you actually need.
