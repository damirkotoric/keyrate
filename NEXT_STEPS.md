# 🚀 Broker Portal - Next Steps

## ✅ What's Done

The complete broker portal has been implemented with:
- ✅ Supabase integration (authentication, database, storage)
- ✅ Dashboard with stats
- ✅ Applications CRUD with search
- ✅ Clients CRUD with search
- ✅ Brokers management (admin only)
- ✅ File upload/download for applications
- ✅ Settings page with password change
- ✅ Role-based access control (broker vs admin)
- ✅ Responsive UI with shadcn components
- ✅ Slide-out sheets for all CRUD operations

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Supabase (30 minutes)

**Action**: Follow `BROKER_PORTAL_SETUP.md` step by step

Key tasks:
- [ ] Create Supabase project
- [ ] Get API keys
- [ ] Add to `.env.local`
- [ ] Run database schema SQL
- [ ] Set up RLS policies
- [ ] Create storage bucket
- [ ] Create first admin user

### 2. Test Locally (15 minutes)

```bash
cd www
npm run dev
```

Visit: http://localhost:3000/portal/login

Test:
- [ ] Login works
- [ ] Dashboard loads
- [ ] Can create a client
- [ ] Can create an application
- [ ] Can upload a document
- [ ] Can change password
- [ ] Can create a broker (if admin)

### 3. Deploy to Production (10 minutes)

```bash
# Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
# Then commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add broker portal"
git push
```

Vercel will auto-deploy.

### 4. Create Your Team

In production:
1. Log in as admin
2. Go to Brokers page
3. Add your team members
4. Send them their credentials

## 🔑 Environment Variables Needed

Create `www/.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

**Note**: Get these from Supabase dashboard after creating your project.

## 📊 Database Tables

Three main tables created automatically via SQL:
1. **clients** - Client information
2. **applications** - Mortgage applications
3. **documents** - Uploaded files metadata

Plus Supabase's built-in:
- **auth.users** - Broker accounts

## 🎨 Portal Structure

```
/portal/login              → Login page (public)
/portal                    → Redirects to /applications
/portal/dashboard          → Stats and recent activity
/portal/applications       → List + CRUD applications
/portal/clients            → List + CRUD clients
/portal/brokers            → List + CRUD brokers (admin only)
/portal/settings           → Change password
```

## 🔐 Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) enforces data isolation
- Brokers see only their clients/applications
- Admins see everything
- File storage is private (authenticated only)
- Service role key required for admin operations

## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Brokers
1. Start by adding clients
2. Then create applications for those clients
3. Upload documents to applications
4. Update application status as you progress

### For Admins
1. Create broker accounts for your team
2. Monitor all applications from dashboard
3. Can view/edit any client or application

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Can't log in
- Check environment variables are set
- Verify user exists in Supabase Auth
- Check user has `role` in metadata

### Can't see any data
- Brokers only see their own clients
- Check broker_id matches logged-in user
- Admins should see everything

### File upload fails
- Verify storage bucket exists: `application-documents`
- Check storage policies are set
- Ensure bucket is private, not public

### RLS errors
- Make sure RLS policies were created
- Check user metadata has `role` field
- Verify SQL was executed successfully

## 📈 Future Enhancements (Don't build yet!)

Wait until you actually need these:
- Email notifications when status changes
- SMS alerts for urgent items
- Export to Excel
- Advanced search/filters
- Commission tracking
- Client portal (separate view for clients)
- Integration with lender APIs
- Calendar for appointments
- Task management

**Philosophy**: Ship now, iterate based on real usage.

## ✨ You're Ready!

Everything is built and ready to use. Just:
1. Set up Supabase (follow setup guide)
2. Test locally
3. Deploy
4. Start using it Monday morning

The portal is intentionally simple. Add features as you discover what you need, not what you think you might need.

**Built with the Pieter Levels philosophy**: Ship fast, iterate based on real usage, keep it simple.

Good luck! 🚀
