# Lenders Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented a standardized Lenders management system for the broker portal. Previously, lenders were entered as free-form text when creating applications. Now they are managed as a separate entity with a dedicated UI.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates

**New Table: `lenders`**
- `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
- `name` (TEXT, NOT NULL, UNIQUE)
- `type` (TEXT, one of: bank, credit_union, monoline, private, other)
- `is_active` (BOOLEAN, default true)
- `notes` (TEXT)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)
- `updated_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)

**Modified Table: `applications`**
- Added `lender_id` (UUID, references lenders.id)
- Added `broker_id` (UUID, references auth.users.id)
- Note: Old schema had `lender` as TEXT field

**Indexes Added:**
- `idx_applications_lender` on `applications(lender_id)`
- `idx_lenders_active` on `lenders(is_active)`

**RLS Policies:**
- All authenticated users can view all lenders
- All authenticated users can manage lenders (create, update, delete)

### 2. New Pages

**`/portal/lenders` Page** (`www/app/portal/(auth)/lenders/page.tsx`)
- Lists all lenders in a table
- Search functionality
- Click to view/edit lender details
- "New Lender" button to create lenders

### 3. New Components

**`LenderSheet` Component** (`www/components/portal/lender-sheet.tsx`)
- View mode: Display lender details
- Edit mode: Form to create/update lenders
- Fields: Name, Type, Status (Active/Inactive), Notes
- Consistent with other sheet components (ClientSheet, BrokerSheet)

### 4. Updated Components

**`PortalLayout` Component** (`www/components/portal/portal-layout.tsx`)
- Added "Lenders" navigation item with Building2 icon
- Positioned between "Clients" and "Brokers"

**`ApplicationSheet` Component** (`www/components/portal/application-sheet.tsx`)
- Changed lender input from text field to Select dropdown
- Loads active lenders from database
- View mode displays lender name from joined lenders table
- Edit mode shows dropdown of active lenders only
- Added Edit button outline variant for consistency

**Other Sheet Components:**
- `ClientSheet`: Updated Edit button to outline variant
- `BrokerSheet`: Updated Edit button to outline variant

### 5. API Routes

**`/api/portal/lenders/route.ts`**
- `GET`: List all lenders (authenticated users only)
- `POST`: Create new lender (authenticated users only)

**`/api/portal/lenders/[id]/route.ts`**
- `GET`: Get single lender by ID
- `PATCH`: Update lender
- `DELETE`: Delete lender

### 6. Documentation

**Updated: `BROKER_PORTAL_SETUP.md`**
- Added lenders table to database schema section
- Added lenders indexes
- Added lenders RLS policies
- Added "Lenders" to navigation list
- Added Step 9: Add Lenders (with SQL script for quick setup)
- Updated testing checklist to include lender testing

**New: `LENDER_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`**
- Complete guide for migrating from old schema (lender as TEXT)
- Step-by-step SQL migration scripts
- Rollback instructions
- Troubleshooting section

**New: `LENDERS_FEATURE_SUMMARY.md`** (this file)
- Overview of all changes
- File-by-file breakdown

## Files Created

1. `/www/app/portal/(auth)/lenders/page.tsx`
2. `/www/components/portal/lender-sheet.tsx`
3. `/www/app/api/portal/lenders/route.ts`
4. `/www/app/api/portal/lenders/[id]/route.ts`
5. `/LENDER_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
6. `/LENDERS_FEATURE_SUMMARY.md`

## Files Modified

1. `/www/components/portal/portal-layout.tsx` - Added Lenders nav item
2. `/www/components/portal/application-sheet.tsx` - Changed lender to Select, added outline variant to Edit button
3. `/www/components/portal/client-sheet.tsx` - Changed Edit button to outline variant
4. `/www/components/portal/broker-sheet.tsx` - Changed Edit button to outline variant
5. `/BROKER_PORTAL_SETUP.md` - Updated documentation

## UI/UX Improvements

### Consistency
- All Edit buttons now use `variant="outline"` for a consistent visual style
- Lenders page follows same pattern as Clients and Brokers pages
- LenderSheet follows same pattern as ClientSheet and BrokerSheet

### User Flow
1. Admin/Broker goes to Lenders page
2. Adds common lenders once
3. When creating applications, selects from standardized list
4. Only active lenders appear in dropdowns
5. Can mark lenders as inactive without deleting them

### Benefits
- **Data Consistency**: No more typos or variations in lender names
- **Better Reporting**: Can aggregate by lender accurately
- **Easier Management**: Centralized place to manage lenders
- **Scalability**: Easy to add lender-specific fields in future (contact info, rates, etc.)

## Testing

All components pass linting with no errors.

### Manual Testing Required
1. Create a new lender
2. Verify lender appears in Lenders page
3. Create new application
4. Verify lender dropdown shows active lenders only
5. Edit an application and change lender
6. Mark a lender as inactive
7. Verify inactive lender doesn't appear in dropdown
8. Search for lenders on Lenders page

### For Existing Installations
- Follow `LENDER_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` to migrate existing data
- Test that old applications still display correct lender names

## Database Migration for New Installations

For fresh installations, the updated schema in `BROKER_PORTAL_SETUP.md` includes everything needed.

For existing installations, run the migration steps in `LENDER_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`.

## Quick Setup SQL

For new installations, after creating the lenders table, run:

```sql
INSERT INTO lenders (name, type, is_active) VALUES
  ('TD Bank', 'bank', true),
  ('RBC Royal Bank', 'bank', true),
  ('Scotiabank', 'bank', true),
  ('BMO Bank of Montreal', 'bank', true),
  ('CIBC', 'bank', true),
  ('National Bank', 'bank', true),
  ('MCAP', 'monoline', true),
  ('Merix Financial', 'monoline', true),
  ('First National', 'monoline', true),
  ('Home Trust', 'bank', true),
  ('Equitable Bank', 'bank', true),
  ('Tangerine', 'bank', true)
ON CONFLICT (name) DO NOTHING;
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential future additions:
- Lender contact information fields
- Lender-specific rate sheets
- Lender product catalogs
- Lender submission APIs integration
- Lender performance analytics
- Per-lender document requirements
- Lender approval rates and timelines

## Technical Notes

- Uses Supabase RLS for security
- All API routes require authentication
- Foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity
- ON DELETE behavior: Applications with deleted lenders will have NULL lender_id
- Consider adding `ON DELETE SET NULL` or `ON DELETE RESTRICT` based on business requirements
